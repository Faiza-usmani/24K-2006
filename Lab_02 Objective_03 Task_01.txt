OBJECTIVE 3: ALGORITHM
TASK 1


Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.


1. Enter two numbers; a divisor(n) and a dividend(m)
2. Divide the two numbers
3. Find the remainder using modulus operator (%)
4. If the remainder is 0, then the n is a divisor of number m 
5. If the remainder is not 0, the n is not a perfect divisor of number  m 
6. To find if resultant is even or odd number, divide it by 2
7. If the remainder is 0 then the resultant is an even number
8. Otherwise the resultant is a odd number

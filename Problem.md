OBJECTIVE 3: ALGORITHM
TASK 1
Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a
divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.
1. Enter two numbers; a divisor(n) and a dividend(m)
2. Make sure the divisor(n) is not 0
3. Divide the two numbers
4. Find the remainder using modulus operator (%)
5. If the remainder is 0, then the n is a divisor of number m
6. If the remainder is not 0, the n is not a perfect divisor of number m
7. To find if divisor is even or odd number, find remainder by modulus operator
8. If the remainder is 0 then the divisor is an even number
9. Otherwise the divisor is a odd number

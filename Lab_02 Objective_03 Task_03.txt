OBJECTIVE 3: ALGORITHM
TASK 3

Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)

1. Ask the user which operation they want to perform ( addition,, subtraction, division, remainder)
2. If the user choose addition or subtraction ( +, - ) ask them to input the amount of number they want to perform the operation on
3. Then ask the user to enter the numbers accordingly
4. If the user choose the division or remainder operation ( /, %), ask the user two numbers
5. If the user chooses addition, add all the number with each other
6. If the user chooses subtraction, subtract all the number from each other
7. If the user chooses division, divide the first number by the second
8. If the user chooses remainder, divide the first number by the second number and store the remainder
9. Display the solution
10. Ask the user if they want to do another calculation
11. If they say yes then go back to step no. 01
12. Else end the program
